Reason: the while acts as if it were running in a subshell, so the changes to i in the while loop can not
effect the value of the global i.

$UID -- current login user
$PWD -- current working directory
|| and && -- far more efficient than the if test 
read and excute -- both permissions for a script to run
./scriptname -- necessary to explicitly invoke the script in the current directory, which is not included in $PATH

partial quoting [""] -- "STRING" preserves (from interpretation) most of the special characters within STRING.
full quoting [''] -- 'STRING' preserves all special characters within STRING. 
                      This is a stronger form of quoting than "STRING".
                      'X' has the same effect of \X .
null command [:] -- "NOP", do-nothing same as pass in Python;
                    true, while : same as while True; 
                    : > file same as cat /dev/null > file, truncates a file to zero length and create it if not exist;
                    placeholder
